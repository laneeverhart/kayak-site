	<h1 id="about-river">About the River</h1>
	<p id="river-info">The Uwharrie River flows south from Asheboro through the Uwharrie Mountains into Lake Tillery, near Albemarle. With long pools of flat water and occasional class one & two white water, it is a good river for the beginner paddler. The Uwharrie is known for being one of the most scenic rivers in the Piedmont, with an abundance of wildlife. On any given day some of the wildlife you may see are otters, osprey, great blue herons, wood ducks, white tail deer and wild turkey.</p>
